# Fast_Code_For_FFT
There are three main scripts: fft.c, fft_openmp.c, fft_cuda.cu, each contributes
to run fft function in baseline solution, OpenMP solution and CUDA solution. To compile these files, use the following commands in terminal.

Compile fft.c
`make baseline`

Compile fft_openmp.c
`make openmp`

Compile fft_cuda.cu
`make cuda`
